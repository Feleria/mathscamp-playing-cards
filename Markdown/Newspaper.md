## Correct Answer

17

## Hint

Can you work backwards from 8 to work out how many sheets would be underneath this one? You might want to use bits of paper and number them to help.

## Explanation

On the back of the number 8 there must be the number 7. The sheet below must have the numbers 6 and 5. Keeping going there will be 4 and 3 and finally 2 and 1. So there are three sheets underneath. Adding on 7 to the 61 gives the last page as 68. Given each sheet has four pages, there are 68 ∕ 4 = 17 sheets.

# Extension 1

## Statement

If it takes 852 digits to number all the pages of a book, in the usual order, what is the number on the last page of the book?

## Hint

How many 1 digit numbers are there? How many 2 digit numbers?

## Correct Answer

320

## Explanation

There are 9 one-digit numbers (the numbers 1 - 9), 90 two-digit numbers (the numbers 10 - 99) and 900 three-digits numbers (the numbers 100 - 999). Altogether this would make 9×1 + 90×2 + 900×3 = 9 + 180 + 2700 = 2889 digits, so the number of pages is less than 999. There are 852 - 9 - 180 = 663 digits used in three digit numbers. 663 ∕ 3 = 221, so there are 221 pages with three digit numbers. 99 + 221 = 320 gives us the answer.  

# Extension 2 

## Statement

Numbering the pages of a book requires printing 200 nines. What is the minimum number of pages the book could have?

## Hint

How many 9s are there in the first 100 numbers?

## Correct Answer

918

## Explanation

Think about the numbers under 100 first. There are 10 numbers ending in 9, and 10 numbers having 9 as their upper digit (90‒99), making for a total of 20 9s. In the same way, we have 20 9s between 100 and 199, and between 200 and 299, etc. So we get 9×20 = 180 9s up to 899. We need 20 more to reach 200 9s. From 900‒999, every number has a 9 at the beginning. Because 909 has two 9s, we get the last 20 9s from the numbers from 900‒918.
