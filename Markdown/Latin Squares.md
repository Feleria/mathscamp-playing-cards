# Main Version

## Statement

Select the 16 J, Q, K and A cards from a pack. Try to put them in a 4 by 4 square so that each rank (J, Q, K, A) and each suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) appears only once in each row and column.

## Further Instructions

This could be a one player puzzle or get a group of people to try it together as it is quite tricky! 

## Strategy tips

Start by ignoring the suits and try to get the ranks in a square so that each rank appears only once in every row and column. 

# Extension 1

## Statement

Create a 5 x 5 square with the same rules but this time include all the 10,J,Q,K,A. You will need an extra suit: you could draw a 10, J, Q, K and A on five separate pieces of paper, making up a new suit of your choice.

## About

This puzzle is an example of a Latin square. Interestingly, if the problem had involved 6 ranks of playing cards it would have been impossible. But with 7 ranks it is quite easy to find a solution. Latin squares are used in medical trials to ensure every participant is allocated to each treatment for the same time period to prove which is the best treatment.
